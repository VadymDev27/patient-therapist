    Welcome to the TOP DD Network study. I am Dr. Bethany Brand. I am one of the TOP DD
researchers. I will accompany you on the path to healing throughout this project. All of the TOP
DD researchers do research as well as treat dissociative clients. We will use what we have
learned from working with hundreds and hundreds of dissociative clients to help you. However,
you also have a lot of strength, creativity and resources within yourself. We want to help you
discover and use your inner resources. Each of you have a great deal of wisdom and strength
or you could have never survived what you experienced in the past. We are very excited that
you are taking part in this important study.

I will try to speak slowly and in simple English for those people for whom English is not their first
language. I am reading a script to make sure I say things in the best way. Unfortunately, that
means that I look away from the camera from time to time as I read. There may be noises
sometimes because I’m filming these videos in my therapy office, not in a soundproof studio. I
hope that my appearance or gestures, or the noises are not too distracting. I try not to move too
much because that could be distracting to some people. Please try to overlook these small
things. I’m definitely not a Hollywood actor or experienced filmmaker! Instead of getting
distracted by me or the background noises, focus instead on all of us around the world working
together to establish a better life for clients who suffer from dissociative symptoms.
Each week, the written script of what I’m saying on the videos will be available on the website
on the same page as the video. Click on the “video script” button if you’d like to read it. If it helps
you to read along as I talk, or to go back to read what I said after you watch the video, feel free
to do that. Sometimes the words may not match exactly what I say on the video due to editing
that we’re doing, but it will be close to what I say. The videos are typically about five minutes
long, but some of the first four introductory videos that give you background information on the
study and different trauma disorders are longer. You can watch all of the videos as many times
as you like. It will work best if you watch the videos week by week, rather than jumping ahead
and watching many videos at one time. We have planned the videos so they present a small
amount of new information each week. Research shows that it takes time to learn new
information and to practice new skills, and that frequent practice helps us learn information
better. If you jump ahead, you may not be able to develop the skills and make changes that will
last. Going too fast is like trying to lose weight too fast – you are likely to not be able to make
the changes last. Richard Kluft, a well-known dissociation expert says, “The slower you go, the
faster you’ll get there.” We know you can get there, that you can work on healing, by working
this program diligently each week, at a slow pace. You’ll get there going slowly and carefully and
we’ll help you do it.

We recommend that each week before you watch the videos and do the writing and practice
exercises that you take a few minutes to calm and ground yourself so that you can truly focus
and learn from the program. To calm and focus yourself, you can do a few minutes of deep
breathing or meditating on your own, or you can watch the brief video called Basic Grounding
and Relaxing. Then, after you’ve calmed and focused yourself each week, please watch that
week’s video and do that week’s writing exercise and practice exercise. Research shows that
writing about one’s thoughts and feelings is beneficial to trauma survivors, so please do the
written exercises. The more you practice the skills in the practice exercises, the easier it will be
to remember to use them when you need them. We hope you make yourself, your healing a real
priority in your life during this year. We hope that you will set aside time each day to practice the
skills. If you truly want to make your healing a priority, you will probably need to work 1 to 2
hours each week watching the videos, doing the writing exercises, and then practicing the skills
each day. Do you doubt whether you are worth the time to do this program? Do you doubt
whether you are worth making your healing a priority? It’s ok if you have doubts. Many

traumatized people have these doubts. We encourage you to notice the doubts, but try to let go
of them whenever they enter your mind. You can do it! Persistence is the key!
We call this program the TOP DD Network study because TOP DD stands for “Treatment of
Patients with Dissociative Disorders”. The word “Network” refers to this being an online
educational program – the first of its kind in the world focused on helping dissociative people.
Our slogan is “working together, learning together” because we hope this program helps you
learn to work within yourself to understand and cope with your symptoms and emotions. We
hope this program helps you to find answers and strengths within yourself. You have
tremendous strengths, otherwise you would never have survived trauma. This program can help
you learn skills and build upon strengths you already have. Also, your feedback throughout this
program will help us learn which topics, videos, writing exercises, and practice exercises are
most helpful to dissociative people. We would like to warmly thank each of you for your
feedback on the videos, writing and practice exercises. With feedback from you, we will be able
to improve this program so it can help even more people in the future. We are confident this
program can help you, and in addition it will be a light of hope for many people for years to
come. We hope it helps you to know you are helping not only yourself but also other people.
Your suffering and hard work mean something. Maybe if you have any days you are not feeling
motivated to do this program, you can remind yourself that it will help you but that it will also
help others. Maybe you can do it for others on the days when it’s not enough to do it for
yourself.
We will be spending the next year together. There are 5 introduction videos, one of which is the
Basic Grounding and Relaxing Exercise. You can see all 5 introduction videos at one time if you
like. The next step is to watch the 40 weekly videos in this program. Even though the TOP DD
Network program takes one year to complete, we made 40 videos rather than one for each
week so that you had some free weeks for holidays and illness. Also, having 40 videos to watch
over the 52 weeks also allows you to slow down if you need to work longer on any topic. When I
refer to the weekly videos, I mean the 40 videos that make up the program. There are many
dissociative patients and their therapists from around the world participating in this TOP DD
Network study. All of you are learning together.
