            <div>You are invited to participate in the Treatment of Patients with Dissociative Disorders (TOP DD) Network Randomized Control Trial (RCT).  The purpose of this study is to determine if participating in the TOP DD Network RCT’s educational program helps patients improve their safety and symptoms. </div>

            <div class="font-bold text-md">Procedures overview:</div>
            <div class="whitespace-pre-line">Participation in the study gives access to a year-long web-based educational program (The TOP DD Network) for patients diagnosed with a dissociative disorder (DD), the dissociative subtype of posttraumatic stress disorder (DPTSD), or complex PTSD.  Therapists of the patients who participate in the study will also be given access to the TOP DD Network program for one year.  The TOP DD Network program is designed to provide information that we hope will help patients learn to manage symptoms and improve their safety.  Both the patient and their therapist must agree to enroll together in the study so that patients have a clinician to help them if they experience safety problems or other difficulties.  The patient and therapist are referred to here as the “treatment team”.

            Eligible study participants will be given access to sign into the secure TOP DD Network website.  The TOP DD Network site will provide access to educational videos, information sheets, written exercises, and practice exercises.  The materials have been designed by the TOP DD team specifically to help dissociative patients learn how to improve their safety and enhance their ability to manage symptoms including PTSD and dissociation.

            Each patient and therapist who would like to be considered for participation will complete a Screening Survey to determine eligibility.  If the treatment team meets criteria to be enrolled, the patient and therapist will be emailed a link to complete the Initial Survey.  In order to determine whether the program helps treatment teams make better progress in therapy, after both members of the treatment team complete the Initial Survey, the treatment team will be randomly assigned to either begin using the educational materials, or to join a wait list for six months before starting to use the educational materials.  Participants will be informed via email which group they have been assigned. The treatment teams who are randomly assigned to be in the six-month wait list will continue treatment as usual together until the sixth month wait period is over.  After the six-month waiting period, they will each receive a link via email to access the TOP DD Network website and educational materials.  Wait list teams will receive emails at months 2 and 4, reminding them how much longer it will be until the link to access the educational materials is sent.

            The TOP DD Network program consists of 34 short videos to watch, plus written and behavioral practice exercises that go along with each video.  For simplicity’s sake, we refer to “weekly” videos, but encourage you to go slower when you need more time to make use of a “week’s” material.  There may be weeks when participants do not watch a new video.  Participants are welcome to watch each video as many times as they like.  Many participants in our past research found that it was very helpful to repeatedly watch the videos.

            After viewing a set of 4 preparation videos, participants will be given access to the first educational video along with an information sheet and written and practice exercises for that topic.  Participants will complete brief questions each time they review a new video to assess their progress in learning the skills taught in the videos and to assess the study’s materials.

            Access to the next video is given once both the therapist and patient have viewed that week’s materials and completed the brief survey and a week has passed.  A week must pass between patients accessing new material to ensure that patients have the opportunity to get sufficient practice with the material presented.  We also want to ensure that therapists are aware of what their patients are working on.

            Survey questions for patients inquire about their symptoms (e.g., dissociation, posttraumatic stress) and use of healthy and risky coping behaviors.

            Participants will not be compensated for participating in the study, nor will they have to pay to access the study’s materials.
