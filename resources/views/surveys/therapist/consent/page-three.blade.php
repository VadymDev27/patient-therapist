            <div class="whitespace-pre-line">Participants may learn ways to improve safety and manage emotions and symptoms in healthy ways.  In addition, future dissociative patients and their therapists may benefit from the participants’ feedback about the study’s educational materials, as well as from the research publications that will be based on the study.  Therapist participants may learn more about helping dissociative patients in general as well as about how to best help the patient who is participating in the study.  Participating in this study as a team may also strengthen the working relationship between patients and their therapists, which research suggests is likely to improve the patient’s progress in treatment.

            <div class="font-bold my-2">Risks/Discomfort:</div>
            <p>We have had individuals who are diagnosed with DD review the TOP DD Network materials and provide feedback about the best way to present the information.  We took this step to ensure that the study is as helpful to participants as possible.  While we do not anticipate significant difficulties for participants, this program asks participants to think about their feelings, reasons for doing unhealthy / unsafe things, symptoms, and related clinical issues.  This may sometimes be uncomfortable.  We encourage patients to discuss their reactions with their therapists, particularly if they become upset by anything in the study.  If any element of the study is distressing, we suggest patients take a break and do something that is safe and calming, and discuss their reaction with their therapist.  We encourage patients to find a pace that feels most comfortable for them when working on the study’s materials.</p>

            <p class="mt-2">It is possible that some therapists will find the study distressing. Sometimes focusing on patients’ safety struggles can increase patient’s awareness of problems with safety and may even increase unsafe urges for some patients, although if discussed carefully in treatment, these increased difficulties are typically resolved. The professional literature indicates that therapists can become distressed about clients’ safety struggles. If this occurs, we encourage therapists to seek out professional support, training in treating severely traumatized patients, consultation, supervision, and/or withdrawing from the study. Therapists can review all the questionnaires that patients will be asked to complete on our website page at (link to be inserted).<p> {{-- TODO: insert link --}}

            <p class="mt-2">The TOP DD researchers are not able to provide consultation, treatment, or feedback on any participant, nor will the team be able to provide information on any patient's progress, or return calls or emails seeking clinical advice.  This limitation in our role is the reason we require patients to be in individual therapy in order to participate in the study. </p>

            <div class="font-bold my-2">Confidentiality:</div>

            <p>To ensure participant confidentiality, we are not collecting any identifying information that could be used to identify participants.  We do not collect participants’ names.    Throughout our surveys, we remind participants to not include any identifying information in the open textbox answers.  Any publications or reports that result from this research will not include identifying information on any participant.</p>

            <p class="mt-2">A computer program will automatically send emails to participants throughout the study so they can access the materials and the surveys. The TOP DD researchers will not see participants’ email addresses.  The website will enable participants who forget their usernames, forget (or need to change) their passwords, or who need to change email addresses to do so by clicking on links embedded on the study’s website and emails. </p>

            <p class="mt-2">All information will remain strictly confidential. We cannot provide copies of the completed surveys to participants nor will data from one member of a treatment team be shared with the other member of the team.  This study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board at Towson University (Protocol 1438). </p>

            <div class="font-bold my-2">Alternatives to Participation:</div>

            <p>Your participation in this study is completely voluntary. You are free to choose not to participate, and if you do choose to participate, you are free to change your mind and withdraw from the study at any time.  There is no penalty for leaving the study early.  You can continue in treatment with your patient regardless of whether you chose to participate or later discontinue participation. </p>

            <div class="font-bold my-2">Withdrawing from the Study:</div>

            <p>Should you choose to withdraw from the study, please complete the Discontinuation Survey, which is accessible from the page you are shown after logging in to the study. This is a brief survey about the reason(s) you would like to withdraw.  Please note: The study’s requirement that patients be in individual therapy means that discontinuing therapy with the current therapist would make the patient ineligible to continue or re-enroll in the study.  Therapists who withdraw from the study with one patient cannot re-enroll with another patient.  Patients may be withdrawn from the study if they or their therapist determines that staying in the study could be harmful or if the therapist stops participating in the study.  </p>

            <p class="mt-2">If you have any questions regarding your rights as a research participant please contact the Institutional Review Board Chairperson, Dr. Elizabeth Katz, Office of University Research Services, 8000 York Road, Towson University, Towson, Maryland 21252; phone (410) 704-2236.
