            <div>You are invited to participate in the Treatment of Patients with Dissociative Disorders (TOP DD) Network Randomized Control Trial (RCT).  The purpose of this study is to determine if participating in the TOP DD Network RCT’s educational program helps patients improve their safety and symptoms. </div>

            <div class="italic my-2">Participation Eligibility:</div>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
                <li>The Patient-Therapist team must have been working together in treatment for at least three months.</li>
                <li>Patients must be over the age of 18, and must meet criteria for one of the following disorders:  Other Specified Dissociative Disorder, Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), Posttraumatic stress disorder, dissociative subtype (PTSD-D), and/or complex PTSD.  </li>
                <li>The Patient and Therapist must agree that the patient needs to learn more about the topics that are the focus of this program: getting and feeling safer and learning how to manage emotions, PTSD symptoms, and dissociation. </li>
                <li>Participants must be able to tolerate non-detailed references to: childhood and adult trauma; safety struggles and underlying reasons for these struggles; dissociation; and occasional brief discussions of “parts of self”.  (If this term does not apply to you, please disregard it.)</li>
                <li>The Patient and Therapist must each agree to watch the educational videos. </li>
                <li>Patients must agree to do the written reflections and experiential exercises that accompany the videos.</li>
                <li>Both Patient and Therapist must have reliable high-speed access to the Internet (and if using a phone for access, have a data plan that can accommodate heavy data use).</li>
                <li>The Patient and Therapist must be aware of the possibility of being randomly assigned to a six-month waiting period before they will be given access to the study’s materials. They agree that they are willing to participate in the study regardless of whether they are randomly assigned to the six-month waiting period or immediate access to the study’s materials.</li>
                <li>The Patient and Therapist must each provide an email address to receive links to study materials and surveys. The TOP DD research team will not see or be able to access participants’ email addresses; the study’s website platform will automatically send emails with survey links at timed intervals so that the researchers will not manually send emails, nor see email addresses.</li>
                <li>The Patient and Therapist must be able to read English.</li>
                <li>If the Patient or Therapist decides to withdraw from the study, both members of the team will be withdrawn.  If either the Patient or Therapist decides to withdraw from the study, they can do so for any reason by filling out the Discontinuation Survey available here (We will insert the link here). </li>
                {{-- TODO: insert discontinuation survey link --}}
                <li>If the Therapist and Patient discontinue treatment together, both will be withdrawn from the study.  (Unfortunately, it is not possible for Patients to re-enroll in the study after withdrawing, even if the Patient begins treatment with a new therapist.) </li>
                <li>Therapists can participate with only one patient.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="italic my-2">Participation Requirements:</div>
            <div class="whitespace-pre-line">Completion of the (1) Screening Survey and (2) Initial Survey by both participants will be required before beginning involvement with the TOP DD Network’s educational materials.  Emails with links to surveys will be sent every six months (i.e., at 6 and 12 months for teams assigned to immediately start the program, and at 6, 12, and18 months for teams assigned to the 6-month waitlist group).  The questionnaires included in this study are essential to assessing the effectiveness of the TOP DD Network program.  They will also help us improve the TOP DD Network program materials for future research.  Wait list teams will also receive emails at 2 and 4 months of being on the wait list to remind them how much longer they have to wait until being sent a link to access the educational materials.

                Therapists need to commit to spending approximately 15-30 minutes each week for one year to participate.  Therapists’ weekly involvement will require watching the same videos as their patients and providing brief feedback.  Therapists are also strongly encouraged to discuss and review patients’ program work with their patients. Therapists must also be willing to complete research surveys requiring up to 1 hour each: a Screening Survey, an Initial Survey, and then one survey every six months thereafter (i.e., at 6 and 12 months, and at 6, 12, and 18 months for teams assigned to the 6 month waitlist control group).

                Participating patients need to commit to doing about 2 hours of work per week for one year, including: Watching short educational videos outside of therapy sessions (between 10-14 minutes), completing brief surveys assessing their progress and the educational materials, completing weekly writing exercises, and practicing recovery-focused skill exercises each day.  Note: The TOP DD researchers will not collect the patients' written reflection exercises.  The written reflections are for the patient's learning.  We encourage patients to share what they are learning about themselves with their therapists. In addition, patients need to commit to completing assessment surveys, each requiring between 1 to 2 hours every six months (i.e., at 6 and 12 months, and at 6, 12, and 18 months for teams assigned to the 6 month waitlist control group).
