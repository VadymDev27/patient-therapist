        DIRECTIONS: This questionnaire consists of twenty-eight questions about experiences that you may have in your daily life.  We are interested in how often you have had these experiences <u><b>in the last month</b></u>.  It is important, however, that your answers show how often these experiences happen to you when you <u>are not</u> under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

        To answer the questions, please determine to what degree the experience described in the question has applied to you <i>in this last month</i> and select the number to show what percentage of the time you have had that experience in the last month.
